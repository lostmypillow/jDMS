# jDMS (Work In Progress)
## What is it?
A full stack web scraper to automate my daily task in the company I intern in. WIP

## Roadmap
1. Create a Go AWS Lambda that the LINE chatbot can POST to, the function then stores the links in Firebase (have it prefetch certain links or use Firebase functions for it?)

2. Desktop Express then fetches the data, gets the rest of the data using Puppeteer, stores them in the on device SQLite, allows read and write


## How does it work?
TBA
   
## Tech Stack
- **Express** API endpoints
- **Puppeteer** and **Cheerio** for HTML download and traversing
